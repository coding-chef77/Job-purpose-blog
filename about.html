          <p>
            Job Purpose Blog is intended to be an open forum of thought,
            inspiration and ideas for people interested in finding purpose in
            what they do in their careers, and for organisations looking to do
            things a little differently perhaps than they have been doing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pandemic has brought about new awareness and openness to try
            something new or different, some forced in loss of jobs, others more
            a personal decision being termed the “the Great Resignation”. There
            is also more awareness that the people in an organization are in
            fact the most precious entity in an organization, and as such it is
            important to really get to know who they are, in order to help them
            be the best they can be, and deliver the results your organization
            are looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even without the pandemic, there is a growing understanding that a
            career is no longer the simple form of a ladder to climb, but a
            journey that might have several different paths. Some refer to it as
            a jungle gym, I see a great tree with multiple core branches and
            endless smaller branches leading off, all intertwined, reaching for
            the sky. What caught my interest, was also that the branches didn’t
            go straight up but sometimes even in circles sometimes not knowing
            which direction they were going in, developing either way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Career journeys will not be straight forward anymore, most likely
            gone are the days somebody joins an organization for life...
            although there are businesses that still value and aim for lifetime
            loyalty. A career can take many paths, learning all the way, with
            hopefully a new understanding from employers as well that skills and
            experience are very transferable. People will hopefully no longer be
            defined by their “job title” but by the skillsets they have acquired
            that can be used across all manner of channels. In my experience,
            supporting people in need whether in a care home, hospital, jungle,
            tropical island or in a global business is all much the same. It
            requires empathy, ability to ask the right questions, keep an open
            mind and a will and competence to get the job done.
          </p>
          <h2>What is Job Purpose?</h2>
          <p>
            Job Purpose was established to support both individuals and
            organisations in matching the right person to the right job roles,
            finding their purpose. We use an advanced People Intelligence
            Platform to assess and create profiles to find what it is a
            particular role requires, and who is best suited to do it best. If
            you’re looking for what the next move might be, our career match
            reports help you understand and have an overview of what you are
            suited to. Ultimately find Job Purpose.

            I hope the blog sparks your interest, raises curiosity, or is useful
            to you in any way.
